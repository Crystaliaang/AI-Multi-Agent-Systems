# AI-Multi-Agent-Systems

AI & Multi-Agent Systems Programming Project Group 60
- Private team project: Group 60 in 2023 â€“ Built as part of a team.
- Main programming project of the course 02285

In this project, we built an advanced client for the MAvis server using the hospital domain. Our goal was to experiment with advanced techniques and architectures in order to efficiently solve a wide range of multiagent levels within the hospital domain.
Instead of relying on the warmup assignment client, which was not efficient, we decided to rebuild our client from scratch. This allowed us to think carefully about how to represent states efficiently. It also made it easier to extend the client with more features as we progressed.
